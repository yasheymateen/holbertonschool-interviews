# Warm Up

---
## Learning Objectives
* Efficiently review material
* Understand binary tree operations
* Searching algorithms
* How to query an API for specific information

---
## Requirements
### C Tasks
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be placed within the corresponding header file stated/implied in the task
All your header files should be include guarded

### Python Scripts
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c ‘print(import(“mymodule”).doc_)’)
* You must use get to access to dictionary value by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist in the dictionary)
* Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if name == “main”:)
